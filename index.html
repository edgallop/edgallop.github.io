                <h3>Acapulco Gold CBD Hemp Flower From CBD Hemp Direct</h3>
                <p>by: Ed Gallop</p>
                <h4>Cannabinoids</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>19.1% CBD</li>
                    <li>0.3% THC</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Primary Terpenes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Caryophyllene</li>
                    <li>Myrcene</li>
                    <li>Humulene</li>
                    <li>Pinene</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A rose by any other name</p>
                <p>I won't lie... I bought this hemp because of the name. For many people my age or older, the name "Acapulco Gold" conjures memories of the legendary marijuana strain that is this hemp's namesake. Long ago in a far away land, I MAY have tried Acapulco Gold. Let me elaborate. I had a friend in nineteen-ninety-something who gave me some super kind bud that he identified as Acapulco Gold. Back in those days, you never really knew what you were getting for sure, but it really fit the bill. The color, and potency matched what I had been told about the legendary Mexican landrace strain. It was yesterday's weed with today's potency.</p>
                <p>When I saw this hemp listed on CBD Hemp Direct's website, I knew I had to try it and I'm glad that I did.</p>
                <h4>Sight</h4>
                <p>This flower comes in the standard CBD Hemp Direct packaging, a smell-proof mylar bag with a humidity packet inside. The buds are of varying size. There was no trim or any popcorn buds in the bag.</p>
                <p>The buds are VERY nicely trimmed. This is the case with all of the flower that I've' bought from CBD Hemp Direct. They really do a good job with trimming.</p>
                <h4>Touch</h4>
                <p>The buds themselves are dense and nicely cured with some spring when squeezed. They are of average stickyness and not too dry, leaving just a little bit of resin on the fingers. The stems break with a very satisfying snap.</p>
                <h4>Aroma</h4>
                <p>In the bag, the aroma is kind of perfumy. Not unplesant at all, but a little overpowering giving me the first impression that this would be a pretty one-dimensional experience. I was wrong. When I broke open a bud, the boquet came alive for me.</p>
                <p>The CBD Hemp Direct website lists this strain's aromas as "citrus, pine and lavender", and I agree. The citrus that I detect is grapefruit, but a sweet grapefruit like a nice deep red one. I do detect pine, but it's understated and nostalgic like walking past the family christmas tree. As far as lavender goes, that's probably the second most distinct aroma of this flower, right behind the grapefruit. I also get black liquorice pretty strongly in front of the pine.</p>
                <h4>Taste</h4>
                <p>This one changes pretty dramatically when you add heat. The aromas are still there, but they are overtaken by an earthiness. A taste of black truffles pushes the before-mentioned aroma profile just slightly into the background making them harder to pick up on the tongue. They're still there, though and very nice to smoke or vape slowly.</p>
                <h4>Sensation</h4>
                <p>The company's website says that this is a sativa dominant hybrid, so I was expecting something uplifting. It doesn't disappoint. I had been putting off writing this review for the past couple of days and after smoking some of this bud, I felt ready to put my brain to work. CBD Hemp Direct claims the effects to be upbeat, energy and focus. I don't personally get the energy but that's not unusual for me. Often sativa dominant hybrids give me a sort of relaxed optimism instead of energy. I only get energized by mostly pure sativas like hazes and such. We're all built differently, and your experience may vary. Focus is right at the forefront of this strain, though. Happy and focused.</p>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>I'm glad that I bought an ounce of this flower. It's delightful. As far as the seller, I've never had a negative experience with them. The prices are very fair, shipping is fast, and their products have yet to disappoint.</p>

                <h3>Cannabis Law</h3>
                <p>May 6, 2020</p>
                <p>by: Ed Gallop</p>
                <p>For many years, I have had an interest in growing cannabis. I've never acted on that interest because of the fear of losing my freedom and the devastation that it would cause my family if I were ever caught.</p>
                <p>That has all changed now since the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill. My home state of Virginia has adopted a very pro-hemp attitude. So it would seem that the time is now for me to begin learning the art of cannabis horticulture.</p>
                <p>I've scoured the internet for information about growing cannabis - and hemp in particular. I've bought and read books on the topic and joined social media groups dedicated to it. I've consulted with friends and even the Department of Agriculture. The growing supplies that I ordered have arrived, and so have my seeds.</p>
                <p>Today, I placed into the mailbox the required forms and fees to the Commonwealth of Virginia. It was a momentous occasion. I have applied for a registration to do what was a felony only a few short years ago.</p>
                <p>It makes one think about how fickle some laws are. The prohibition of hemp because it looks like marijuana ended two years ago. As of this year's legislative session, there will be a change in the total thc allowed in hemp plants. The limit will change from the arbitrary 0.3% chosen by the federal government to a more achievable 1%.</p>
                <p>Not long ago, our state legislature decriminalized simple possession of marijuana. Our state also has approved a more viable medical marijuana program. Our medical patients will no longer be criminals, and they'll have access to a variety of products. These are huge victories for liberty-minded Virginians, but the fight isn't over by a long shot. We cannot stop until all cannabis plants and products are legal nationwide.</p>
                <p>I urge you to get involved. Call your state and federal representatives. Send letters to lawmakers. Make your voice heard. Stand with other people who have the same goal. If you're not already a member, join NORML today!</p>

                <p>We are just regular people who believe that cannabis has the potential to change the world for the better. We have experienced the healing power of the cannabis plant, and the peaceful nature of the people who use it. Hemp can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and our misuse of Earth's other precious resources. Because of this belief, we want to share with the cannabis community any useful information we come across. We also advocate for not only the legalization of all cannabis plants, but also their widespread use for the good of all people and the planet we call home.</p>
                <p>This website exists to share knowlege, experiences, and good vibes with other people who either use cannabis, or are thinking about trying cannabis. For those who are on the fence about issues related to the legalization of hemp and/or marijuana, we hope to demonstrate through a good example, the value of the plant and its users to society.</p>
